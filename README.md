Single-Shot Miller Rabin is the fastest primality test for small integers


Most casual recreational mathematics applications of primality only deal with small integers. This primality test tries to be the fastest possible for those integers. It is currently accurate for values slightly greater than 2^37 (137512792873). This is approximately 32 times higher than any other primality test that uses a single base.
